If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
I uploaded a rare animal photo, Quakka and an aeroplane as the object.

All three model architectures are able to classify the aeroplane as airliner.

However, all three model architectures classify Quakka differently but somewhat similar to Quakka.
Alexnet classified as beaver; Resnet classified as wombat; VGG classified as wallaby, brush kangaroo.
